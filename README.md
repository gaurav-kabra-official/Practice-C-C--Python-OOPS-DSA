## About 
This repository has been created to collect major study material references I referred to during my learning journey in C, C++, Java and Python. It also contains the material related to Object Oriented Programming (OOPS) and Data Structures & Algorithms(DSA).<br>
Not all material is created by me but the codes and all mine. You might find a better approach or even a bug! I would be happy in that case if you contribute to the betterment of this repository by pointing this out.<br>
Most material I studied in my 1t year has been lost as in those days I did not use to save each and every work. But whatever is there with me and is worth spreading for handling the torch of light of knowledge to others is here now.<br>
I welcome you to further add your articles.<br>
