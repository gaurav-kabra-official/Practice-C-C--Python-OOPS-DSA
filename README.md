## About 
This repository has been created to collect major study material references I referred to during my learning journey in C, C++, Java and Python under one roof. It also contains the material related to Object Oriented Programming (OOPS) and Data Structures & Algorithms(DSA).<br>
Not all material is created by me but the codes are all mine. You might find a better approach or even a bug! I would be happy in that case if you contribute to the betterment of this repository by pointing this out.<br>
Most material I studied in my 1st year has been lost as in those days I did not use to save each and every work. But whatever is there with me and is worth sharing is here now.<br>
I welcome you to further add your articles.<br>
##### Note
